## About the Project

Each folder corresponds to a question and includes its respective unit test.

I haven't created a sophisticated test or application architecture, so I tested everything in the same files and left some comments. If the intention is to verify a solid architecture, I have projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/richardpassos01/skeleton_ts_backend) that might be of interest.
